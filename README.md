# Bmi Calculator
This is a very simple mobile app for calculating your BMI.
I built this using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [expo](https://expo.dev/).

## Project Page Link

Scan the QR code to open the app in Expo Go.

## Getting Started
First install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
#or
npm run install
```

Then run the project using the command below:

```bash
yarn start
#or
npm run start
```

This will start the expo development server.

Note that you will need to have the Expo Go app installed, either on your device or on your simulator device (if you have any android or ios simulators set up).
